This script sets up a raspberry pi to be a TOR proxy for all internet traffic 
leaving your mesh node.  Since most people using a mesh node desire some sort
of anonymity on the internet, this allows us to serve our mission of protecting
users who are using our service.

This would also serve protect the outbound node owner from possible DMCA
complaints, due to the possibility of malicious users.

Basically, install a new RPi Raspbian install, copy this script over, and then
execute it as root.  It will display a short help to provide tips, hints, and
credits.
